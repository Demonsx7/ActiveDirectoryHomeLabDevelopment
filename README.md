<h1>Active Directory HomeLAB Development Process Documentation</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project shows how to set up and configure an entire Active Directory (AD) Home Lab environment.  The lab demonstrates my critical abilities in network administration, system configuration, and identity management using a Windows client computer and Windows Server as a domain controller.   <br /> <br/> Installing and setting up AD Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, group policies, user and group management, and domain-joining client systems are all part of the project.  To replicate a realistic enterprise environment, virtualisation tools like VirtualBox and PowerShell administrative scripting are utilised. <br /> <br/> This home lab demonstrates my achievement of practical experience in creating a directory services infrastructure that is safe, scalable, and operational.
